We can see how there are significant increases from previous year (2016). Which are the good signs that business is thriving. Total yearly sales performance also increases each month be it in year 2016 or year 2017. Breaking down to the Total Profit Performance, we can see how the highest discount also has the highest sales at the time, and less profit on Nov 2017. This could mean that they're selling out-of-season items, or seasonal sales at the time.
